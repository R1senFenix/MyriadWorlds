    <p>
      Dare to create world. A world that is living, one that moves, flows and
      molds to your own whim. Let your friends explore the lands and seas of
      your mind; skies where dragons are the norm, ancient spells whose runes
      are set to be rediscovered, mysterious secrets inside cities of bronze and
      steam. Develop or borrow rules of all kinds to fit what you have dreamed.
      Myriad Worlds Developer easily stores, collects and enables you mold
      realities, birth heroes and villains, and craft the greatest stories one
      could even imagine. Your worlds are a Myriad of possibilities.
