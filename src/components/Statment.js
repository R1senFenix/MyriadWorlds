                Dare to create world. A world that is living, one that moves, flows and
                molds to your own whim. Let your friends explore the lands and seas of
                your mind; skies where dragons are the norm, ancient spells whose runes
                are set to be rediscovered, mysterious secrets inside cities of bronze
                and steam. Develop or borrow rules of all kinds to fit what you have
                dreamed. Myriad Worlds Developer easily stores, collects and enables you
                mold realities, birth heroes and villains, and craft the greatest
                stories one could even imagine. Your worlds are a Myriad of
                possibilities.
